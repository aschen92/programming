<h1> Project: Probing the Limits of Search</h1>
<hr>

This project is open-ended.  Your goal is to try out some different
search stategies in the Eight Puzzle and Vacuum Cleaner World to
arrive at some conclusions concerning the size/complexity of the
problems that can be solved using various techniques.  You should
perform searches using breadth-first, iterative deepening, iterative
deepening with cycle-check, and iterative deepening with cycle-check
and heuristic pruning (ida* to be discussed in class). Optionally, you
might also try implementing breadth-first graph search (cycle
checking) and A* (to be discussed in class).

Your tasks are:
<ol>

<li> Experiment with various uninformed search algorithms on the
eight-puzzle problem (bf_search, id_search).

<li> Complete the successor and solution predicates for vc_world.pl.

<li> Design some Vacuum World test environments of differing
complexity levels.  You might use the random generator to suggest some
for you. See how well bf_search and id_search do.  Also, how do they
do on "average" (random) problems for a given size environment.
(e.g. is breadth-first search a reasonble strategy for 2x2 rooms?
What about 3x3, 4x4 and larger?

<li> Extend id_search with cycle checking and analyze its performance on both
eight-puzzle and vacuum world. Does it help or hurt?

<li> Code up the Manhattan distance heuristic for the 8-puzzle and see
how much it helps, using ida_search. Your heuristic "function" will be
a predicate h(state, H) the returns the H value of a state.

<li> Add cycle checking to the ida_search and try it out.

<li> Try to devise some useful heuristics for the vaccum
world. Initially try using 2*(number of dirty cells). You might want
to tweak the ida_search so that it takes the heuristic predicate as a
parameter; then you can easily try out some variations.

<li> Try to come up with some better heuristics, implement them and
compare.

<li> You might also try your hand at writing some other search
algorithms and trying them on these problems. Here are some
  suggestions:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>breadth-first graph search (bf with cycle checking).
    <li>A* algorithm (bf plus heuristic)
    <li>ida_search with random operator ordering
</ul>

<li> Write up your results and conclusions. It helps if you keep
careful track as you go along of what you tried and what the results
were. Be sure to hand in any code you write, as well.
</ol>

<p> <b>Have Fun!</b>

<h2> Resources: </h2>
All of these can be found in the search subdirectory of the handouts folder.
<ul>
<li> Implemented search algorithms: iterative deepening
  (df_searches.pl), breadth-first search (bf_search.pl), iterative
  deepening with heuristic pruning (ida_search.pl).
<li> Complete search formulation for the 8 puzzle (eightpuzzle.pl).
<li> Seed code for Vacuum World searching (vc_world.pl).
<li> Useful predicates for timing stuff (time.pl).
<li> Description of the data structure libraries for use with this
  project (search_data_structs.html). Also the queue (queues.pl) and
  set (sets.pl) libraries. Heaps are part of the SWI-Prolog standard library.
